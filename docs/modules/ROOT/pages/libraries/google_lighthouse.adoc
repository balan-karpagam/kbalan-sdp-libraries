= Google Lighthouse 

This library integrates https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse[Google Lighthouse] to scan a frontend application for performance, accessibility compliance, search engine optimization, and best practice violations. 

The great part about this library is that developers can also use Google Lighthouse when developing locally in Chrome and these practices can be enforced via the pipeline.

== Additional Common Configuration Options for SDP library steps
.Common Configuration Options
|===
| *Field* | *Description* | *Default Value*

| agentType
| This sets the agentType of the jenkins agent on which this step should be run. This value overrides the settings in the SDP library. Possible values are "kubernetes" "docker" and "generic".
| value from default SDP library configuration else "generic"

| nodeLabel
| This provides the label of the static jenkins agent on which to execute this pipeline step. This value is applicable for agentType "docker" and "generic". For "kubernetes" agent type, the nodes are dynamically launched and the label is automaticaly generated.
| value from default SDP library configuration else none

| images
| This block is used when agentType is "docker". It provies information on accessing the Docker image this step  needs to use. The values in this block overrrides the values in the SDP library configuration. Nonetheless, using the combination of what is declared here and the default SDP library configuration values, this library step must be able to access and pull the image it needs from the registry
|

| images.registry
| This sets the registry the where this step expects to find its Docker images
| value from default SDP library configuration else none

| images.repository
| The first https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-registry-v2-spec-and-repository-naming-rule/5466[path component] in the repository name, e.g. if your images follow the format ``my-registry.com/sdp/*``, this would be *sdp*
| value from default SDP library configuration else none

| images.cred
| Credentials used to pull images from the specified repository
| value from default SDP library configuration else none

| images.img
| Name of the default image to use
| "google-lighthouse"

| images.docker_args
| Arguments to use when starting the container. Uses the same flags as `docker run`
| value from default SDP library configuration else none

| podSpec
| This block is used when agentType is "kubernetes". It provies information on accessing the container images that needs to be used to launch a dynamic pod in which this step is to be executed. The values in this block overrrides  the values in the SDP library configuration. Nonetheless, using the combination of what is declared here and in the SDP library configuration values, the step must be able to access and pull the image it needs from the registry. In addition to information on the container image, this block also provides the namespace in which to launch the pod and the cloud / cluster into which the pod must be launched
|

| podSpec.registry
| This sets the registry the library step expects to find the container images
| value from default SDP library configuration else none

| podSpec.repository
| The first https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-registry-v2-spec-and-repository-naming-rule/5466[path component] in the repository name, e.g. if your images follow the format ``my-registry.com/sdp/*``, this would be *sdp*
| value from default SDP library configuration else none

| podSpec.cred
| Credentials used to pull images from the specified repository
| value from default SDP library configuration else none

| podSpec.img
| Name of the image to use
| "google-lighthouse"

| podSpec.cloud
| Name of the kubernetes cluster / cloud as defined in the Jenkins master configuration to launch the pod in
| value from default SDP library configuration else  "kubernetes"

| podSpec.namespace
| Name of the kubernetes namespace to launch the pod in (this namespace must exist in the cluster)
| value from default SDP library configuration else default

[IMPORTANT]
====

The value in "images.registry" _does_ include the protocol (http/https) while the value in "podSpec.registry" does not include the protocol (http/https).
